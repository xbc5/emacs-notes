A project hierarchy for Org Agenda and Org-roam.

Projects are a hierarchical space (directories and files) that contain
(real-life) project-related notes, links, and knowledge. They serve as a
working memory. The goal of Neutron is to auto-manage the hierarchy,
allowing you to create and incubate ideas over time before undertaking work.
Use projects as a central hub to keep you contextually informed.


## PROJECT ELEMENTS

Each project has an index.org file, which is the entry point and main
workspace. It contains tasks, notes, data, tables, etc.

At the top of each index file there's an index section—which Neutron
auto-generates—that links the hierarchy in a graph. The index maintains
links to the parent, children, and siblings, and each link has a summary,
which it gets from the relevant "summary" section of each note.

Sibling notes are mere workspaces for data, ideas, specifications, and
everything else. They're Org-roam files with no special significance. When
you save one of these files, it creates a two-way index link with the local
index.org file (its sibling index.org).

Index.org files are special. They're the main hub for a project (or
sub-project). They contain an Org Agenda to-do list.


## USING PROJECTS

Neutron's project system is hierarchical, with arbitrarily nested
projects. Start by creating one parent project (e.g., a software app), then
create sub-projects for focused work (like a Git branch). If you find a
sub-project requires significant work, you can further create nested
sub-projects to divide and conquer.

Project contents are temporary. While the data may last for years, it's not
permanent. Use notes outside of projects for facts that don't belong to them.
The general idea is that projects function as a working memory.

One of the primary features of Neutron is project management, and so you can
easily create, move, and delete projects. There are three functions to
assist you:

- 'neutron-create-project'
- 'neutron-move-project'
- 'neutron-delete-project'

These functions automatically manage the graph links and allow you to freely
restructure projects as you wish.
